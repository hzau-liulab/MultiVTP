GO:0042308	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of the movement of proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.
GO:0004860	Binds to and stops, prevents or reduces the activity of a protein kinase.
GO:0005515	Binding to a protein.
GO:0004864	Binds to and stops, prevents or reduces the activity of a protein phosphatase.
GO:0070062	A vesicle that is released into the extracellular region by fusion of the limiting endosomal membrane of a multivesicular body with the plasma membrane. Extracellular exosomes, also simply called exosomes, have a diameter of about 40-100 nm.
GO:0006605	The process of targeting specific proteins to particular regions of the cell, typically membrane-bounded subcellular organelles. Usually requires an organelle specific protein sequence motif.
GO:0048471	Cytoplasm situated near, or occurring around, the nucleus.
GO:0017053	A protein complex that possesses activity that prevents or downregulates transcription.
GO:0044877	Binding to a macromolecular complex.
GO:0045744	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway.
GO:0005829	The part of the cytoplasm that does not contain organelles but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein complexes.
GO:0005774	The lipid bilayer surrounding the vacuole and separating its contents from the cytoplasm of the cell.
GO:0140311	Binding to a protein to prevent it from interacting with other partners or to inhibit its localization to the area of the cell or complex where it is active.
GO:0019899	Binding to an enzyme, a protein with catalytic activity.
GO:0042802	Binding to an identical protein or proteins.
GO:0008104	Any process in which a protein is transported to, or maintained in, a specific location.
GO:0005634	A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.
GO:0005773	A closed structure, found only in eukaryotic cells, that is completely surrounded by unit membrane and contains liquid material. Cells contain one or several vacuoles, that may have different functions from each other. Vacuoles have a diverse array of functions. They can act as a storage organelle for nutrients or waste products, as a degradative compartment, as a cost-effective way of increasing cell size, and as a homeostatic regulator controlling both turgor pressure and pH of the cytosol.
GO:0042470	A tissue-specific, membrane-bounded cytoplasmic organelle within which melanin pigments are synthesized and stored. Melanosomes are synthesized in melanocyte cells.
GO:0051219	Binding to a phosphorylated protein.
GO:0019904	Binding to a specific domain of a protein.
GO:0050815	Binding to a phosphorylated serine residue within a protein.
GO:0042826	Binding to histone deacetylase.
GO:0005925	A cell-substrate junction that anchors the cell to the extracellular matrix and that forms a point of termination of actin filaments. In insects focal adhesion has also been referred to as hemi-adherens junction (HAJ).
GO:0016020	A lipid bilayer along with all the proteins and protein complexes embedded in it and attached to it.
GO:0045944	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of transcription from an RNA polymerase II promoter.
GO:0045892	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of cellular DNA-templated transcription.
GO:0045296	Binding to cadherin, a type I membrane protein involved in cell adhesion.
GO:0007165	The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell.
GO:0032991	A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together.
GO:0005737	The contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures.
