GO:0005515	Binding to a protein.
GO:0000307	Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are enzyme complexes that contain a kinase catalytic subunit associated with a regulatory cyclin partner.
GO:0019901	Binding to a protein kinase, any enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group, usually from ATP, to a protein substrate.
GO:0000082	The mitotic cell cycle transition by which a cell in G1 commits to S phase. The process begins with the build up of G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (G1 CDK), resulting in the activation of transcription of G1 cyclins. The process ends with the positive feedback of the G1 cyclins on the G1 CDK which commits the cell to S phase, in which DNA replication is initiated.
GO:0042098	The expansion of a T cell population by cell division. Follows T cell activation.
GO:0043539	Binds to and increases the activity of a protein serine/threonine kinase.
GO:0005829	The part of the cytoplasm that does not contain organelles but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein complexes.
GO:0051726	Any process that modulates the rate or extent of progression through the cell cycle.
GO:0005654	That part of the nuclear content other than the chromosomes or the nucleolus.
GO:0005634	A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.
GO:0004693	Cyclin-dependent catalysis of the reactions: ATP + protein serine = ADP + protein serine phosphate, and ATP + protein threonine = ADP + protein threonine phosphate.
GO:1900087	Any signaling pathway that increases or activates a cell cycle cyclin-dependent protein kinase to modulate the switch from G1 phase to S phase of the mitotic cell cycle.
GO:0042127	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell proliferation.
GO:0016538	Modulates the activity of a cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase, enzymes of the protein kinase family that are regulated through association with cyclins and other proteins.
GO:0061575	Binds to and increases the activity of a cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase.
GO:0097130	A protein complex consisting of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Cyclins are characterized by periodicity in protein abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinases represent a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that become active upon binding to a cyclin regulatory partner.
GO:0005815	An intracellular structure that can catalyze gamma-tubulin-dependent microtubule nucleation and that can anchor microtubules by interacting with their minus ends, plus ends or sides.
GO:0007165	The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell.
GO:0000122	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II.
GO:0051301	The process resulting in division and partitioning of components of a cell to form more cells; may or may not be accompanied by the physical separation of a cell into distinct, individually membrane-bounded daughter cells.
GO:0097133	A protein complex consisting of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). Cyclins are characterized by periodicity in protein abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinases represent a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that become active upon binding to a cyclin regulatory partner.
GO:0005737	The contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures.
