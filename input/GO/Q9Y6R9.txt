GO:0030030	A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of a prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.
GO:0042802	Binding to an identical protein or proteins.
GO:0034451	A small (70-100 nm) cytoplasmic granule that contains a number of centrosomal proteins; centriolar satellites traffic toward microtubule minus ends and are enriched near the centrosome.
GO:0005815	An intracellular structure that can catalyze gamma-tubulin-dependent microtubule nucleation and that can anchor microtubules by interacting with their minus ends, plus ends or sides.
GO:0005856	A cellular structure that forms the internal framework of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The cytoskeleton includes intermediate filaments, microfilaments, microtubules, the microtrabecular lattice, and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long-range order within the cell. The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions, including cellular movement, cell division, endocytosis, and movement of organelles.
GO:0042995	A prolongation or process extending from a cell, e.g. a flagellum or axon.
GO:0005515	Binding to a protein.
GO:0120103	A protein complex which assembles on the mother centriole during cilium formation, adjacent and proximal to a centriolar distal appendage. In human, it contains ODF2, CNTRL, NIN, CCDC120c and CCDC68.
GO:0098534	A cellular process that results in the assembly of one or more centrioles.
GO:0090307	Mitotic bipolar spindle assembly begins with spindle microtubule nucleation from the separated spindle pole body, includes spindle elongation during prometaphase, and is complete when all kinetochores are stably attached the spindle, and the spindle assembly checkpoint is satisfied.
GO:0036064	A membrane-tethered, short cylindrical array of microtubules and associated proteins found at the base of a eukaryotic cilium (also called flagellum) that is similar in structure to a centriole and derives from it. The cilium basal body is the site of assembly and remodeling of the cilium and serves as a nucleation site for axoneme growth. As well as anchoring the cilium, it is thought to provide a selective gateway regulating the entry of ciliary proteins and vesicles by intraflagellar transport.
GO:0005813	A structure comprised of a core structure (in most organisms, a pair of centrioles) and peripheral material from which a microtubule-based structure, such as a spindle apparatus, is organized. Centrosomes occur close to the nucleus during interphase in many eukaryotic cells, though in animal cells it changes continually during the cell-division cycle.
GO:0008017	Binding to a microtubule, a filament composed of tubulin monomers.
GO:0005737	The contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures.
