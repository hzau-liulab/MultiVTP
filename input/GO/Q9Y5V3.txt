GO:0042981	Any process that modulates the occurrence or rate of cell death by apoptotic process.
GO:0050680	Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the rate or extent of epithelial cell proliferation.
GO:2001235	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of apoptotic signaling pathway.
GO:0005515	Binding to a protein.
GO:0006357	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II.
GO:0003713	A transcription coregulator activity that activates or increases the transcription of specific gene sets via binding to a DNA-binding transcription factor at a specific genomic locus, either on its own or as part of a complex. Coactivators often act by altering chromatin structure and modifications. For example, one class of transcription coactivators modifies chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones. A second class remodels the conformation of chromatin in an ATP-dependent fashion. A third class modulates interactions of DNA-bound DNA-binding transcription factors with other transcription coregulators. A fourth class of coactivator activity is the bridging of a DNA-binding transcription factor to the general (basal) transcription machinery. The Mediator complex, which bridges sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors and RNA polymerase, is also a transcription coactivator.
GO:1900181	Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of protein localization to nucleus.
GO:0005829	The part of the cytoplasm that does not contain organelles but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein complexes.
GO:0090190	Any process that increases the rate, frequency or extent of branching involved in ureteric bud morphogenesis, the process in which the branching structure of the ureteric bud is generated and organized. The ureteric bud is an epithelial tube that grows out from the metanephric duct. The bud elongates and branches to give rise to the ureter and kidney collecting tubules.
GO:0042802	Binding to an identical protein or proteins.
GO:0005634	A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.
GO:0005886	The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer and associated proteins.
GO:0032922	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of gene expression such that an expression pattern recurs with a regularity of approximately 24 hours.
GO:0016020	A lipid bilayer along with all the proteins and protein complexes embedded in it and attached to it.
GO:0045892	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of cellular DNA-templated transcription.
GO:0034504	A process in which a protein transports or maintains the localization of another protein to the nucleus.
GO:0042752	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of a circadian rhythm. A circadian rhythm is a biological process in an organism that recurs with a regularity of approximately 24 hours.
GO:0006355	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cellular DNA-templated transcription.
GO:0045893	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of cellular DNA-templated transcription.
GO:0048511	Any process pertinent to the generation and maintenance of rhythms in the physiology of an organism.
GO:0000122	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II.
GO:0032991	A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together.
GO:0005737	The contents of a cell excluding the plasma membrane and nucleus, but including other subcellular structures.
GO:0000785	The ordered and organized complex of DNA, protein, and sometimes RNA, that forms the chromosome.
