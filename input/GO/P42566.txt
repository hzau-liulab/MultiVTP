GO:0019065	Any receptor-mediated endocytosis that is involved in the uptake of a virus into a host cell; successive instances of virus endocytosis result in the accumulation of virus particles within the cell.
GO:0032456	The directed movement of membrane-bounded vesicles from endosomes back to the plasma membrane, a trafficking pathway that promotes the recycling of internalized transmembrane proteins.
GO:0005515	Binding to a protein.
GO:0005905	A part of the endomembrane system in the form of an invagination of a membrane upon which a clathrin coat forms, and that can be converted by vesicle budding into a clathrin-coated vesicle. Coated pits form on the plasma membrane, where they are involved in receptor-mediated selective transport of many proteins and other macromolecules across the cell membrane, in the trans-Golgi network, and on some endosomes.
GO:0045202	The junction between an axon of one neuron and a dendrite of another neuron, a muscle fiber or a glial cell. As the axon approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic terminal bouton, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the terminal bouton is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic terminal bouton secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane.
GO:0030136	A vesicle with a coat formed of clathrin connected to the membrane via one of the clathrin adaptor complexes.
GO:0016235	An inclusion body formed by dynein-dependent retrograde transport of an aggregated protein on microtubules.
GO:0060170	The portion of the plasma membrane surrounding a cilium.
GO:0006897	A vesicle-mediated transport process in which cells take up external materials or membrane constituents by the invagination of a part of the plasma membrane to form a new membrane-bounded vesicle.
GO:0005829	The part of the cytoplasm that does not contain organelles but which does contain other particulate matter, such as protein complexes.
GO:0030674	The binding activity of a protein that brings together two or more macromolecules in contact, permitting those molecules to function in a coordinated way. The adaptor can bring together two proteins, or a protein and another macromolecule such as a lipid or a nucleic acid.
GO:0098843	A stably positioned site of clathrin adjacent and physically attached to the postsynaptic specialization, which is the site of endocytosis of post-synaptic proteins.
GO:0005769	A membrane-bounded organelle that receives incoming material from primary endocytic vesicles that have been generated by clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytosis; vesicles fuse with the early endosome to deliver cargo for sorting into recycling or degradation pathways.
GO:0016324	The region of the plasma membrane located at the apical end of the cell.
GO:0030122	A heterotetrameric AP-type membrane coat adaptor complex that consists of alpha, beta2, mu2 and sigma2 subunits, and links clathrin to the membrane surface of a vesicle, and the cargo receptors during receptor/clathrin mediated endocytosis. Vesicles with AP-2-containing coats are normally found primarily near the plasma membrane, on endocytic vesicles. In at least humans, the AP-2 complex can be heterogeneric due to the existence of multiple subunit isoforms encoded by different alpha genes (alphaA and alphaC).
GO:0070086	Endocytosis of a protein that requires the substrate to be modified by ubiquitination. Several plasma membrane proteins, including cell surface permeases and some receptors, are targeted for internalization by endocytosis, and are thereafter delivered to the vacuole or lysosome, where they are degraded.
GO:0030132	The coat found on coated pits and the coated vesicles derived from coated pits; comprises clathrin and the AP-2 adaptor complex.
GO:0042802	Binding to an identical protein or proteins.
GO:0001921	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of receptor recycling.
GO:0005886	The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer and associated proteins.
GO:0005768	A vacuole to which materials ingested by endocytosis are delivered.
GO:0046872	Binding to a metal ion.
GO:0015031	The directed movement of proteins into, out of or within a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transporter or pore.
GO:0016197	The directed movement of substances mediated by an endosome, a membrane-bounded organelle that carries materials enclosed in the lumen or located in the endosomal membrane.
GO:0016050	A process that is carried out at the cellular level which results in the assembly, arrangement of constituent parts, or disassembly of a vesicle.
GO:0009925	The region of the plasma membrane located at the basal end of the cell. Often used in reference to animal polarized epithelial membranes, where the basal membrane is the part attached to the extracellular matrix, or in plant cells, where the basal membrane is defined with respect to the zygotic axis.
GO:0098884	A receptor-mediated endocytosis process that results in the internalization of a neurotransmitter receptor from the postsynaptic membrane endocytic zone into an endocytic vesicle.
GO:0005509	Binding to a calcium ion (Ca2+).
GO:0016020	A lipid bilayer along with all the proteins and protein complexes embedded in it and attached to it.

GO:0098978	A synapse that uses glutamate as a neurotransmitter.
GO:0006895	The directed movement of substances from the Golgi to early sorting endosomes. Clathrin vesicles transport substances from the trans-Golgi to endosomes.
