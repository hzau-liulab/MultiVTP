# Description 
MultiVTP is a multilabel model for virus target protein prediction that integrates graph representation learning with multimodal information. The algorithm first samples subgraphs centered on query proteins via random walks to capture neighborhood contexts. It then extracts both network topological features and multimodal representations for each node. Following extraction, these features are integrated within subgraphs through a graph transformer module. Finally, the Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) module is introduced to process the embeddings for each virus prediction task, enabling multilabel prediction.
